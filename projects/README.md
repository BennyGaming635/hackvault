# BEFORE MAKING A PR!

Please ensure in your PR you create a folder in this folder (/projects), with your submissions name.
An example project has been included to see how to set this up.

A README.md should also be created in this new folder with your Name and project name and a brief outline of it. You could also feature a link to your github repo instead.

If possible, please store your finished product including code in that folder.

Thanks!
